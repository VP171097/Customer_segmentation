# Customer_segmentation
Customer segmentation is important for businesses to understand their target audience. Different advertisements can be curated and sent to different audience segments based on their demographic profile, interests, and affluence level.

we will be looking at a popular unsupervised learning technique called K-Means clustering.

This algorithm can take in unlabelled customer data and assign each data point to clusters.

The goal of K-Means is to group all the data available into non-overlapping sub-groups that are distinct from each other.

That means each sub-group/cluster will consist of features that distinguish them from other clusters.

K-Means clustering is a commonly used technique by data scientists to help companies with customer segmentation. It is an important skill to have, and most data science interviews will test your understanding of this algorithm/your ability to apply it to real life scenarios.
